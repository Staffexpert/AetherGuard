The `GUIManager` class in the `com.aetherguard.managers` package manages all graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the AetherGuard anti-cheat plugin. It provides functionality to open specific GUIs for players, optionally passing additional data, and ensures appropriate feedback if a GUI is unavailable. The class also supports closing all open GUIs for all online players. It interacts with the main plugin instance to access configuration messages and player information, facilitating seamless GUI management within the plugin environment.
