The `PlayerReputationSystem` class manages player reputation data for Bukkit-based Minecraft servers. It uses a thread-safe map to store individual player profiles, each containing a reputation score and violation count. The system allows recording violations that reduce reputation by 5 points (not dropping below 0), and increasing reputation by 1 point per clean hour without violations (up to a maximum of 100). It provides methods to retrieve a player's current reputation, defaulting to 50 if no data exists, and to check if a player is considered "trusted" based on having a reputation above 75. The nested `ReputationProfile` class encapsulates the reputation and violation details for each player, enabling ongoing monitoring and adjustment of player trustworthiness.
