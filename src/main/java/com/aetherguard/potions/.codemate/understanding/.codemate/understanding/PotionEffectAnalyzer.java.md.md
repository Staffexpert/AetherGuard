The PotionEffectAnalyzer class analyzes a player's active potion effects to determine a suspicion score that reflects potentially abnormal or cheating-related effects. It evaluates each effect's amplifier level and duration, increasing the suspicion score if any amplifier exceeds 5 or if the duration is longer than 1,000,000 ticks. The final suspicion score is capped at 100, providing a metric to identify impossible or suspicious potion effects on players.
