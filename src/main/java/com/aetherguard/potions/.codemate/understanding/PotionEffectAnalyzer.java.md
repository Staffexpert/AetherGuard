The PotionEffectAnalyzer class provides a method to evaluate a player's active potion effects and calculate a "suspicion" score indicating the likelihood of impossible or suspicious potion effects. It increases the suspicion score if any effect has an amplifier greater than 5 or a duration exceeding 1,000,000 ticks, capping the final score at 100. This can be used to detect potentially unfair or hacked potion effects in a Minecraft server environment.
