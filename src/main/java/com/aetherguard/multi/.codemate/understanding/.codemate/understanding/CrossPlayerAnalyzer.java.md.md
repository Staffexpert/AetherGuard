CrossPlayerAnalyzer is a utility class aimed at identifying potential multi-accounting by analyzing and comparing player behavior data. It maintains a thread-safe map of player behaviors, each keyed by a unique player UUID. The class records snapshots of player behavior, including attributes like IP address and client brand, encapsulated within an inner PlayerBehavior class. By comparing a given player's current behavior against stored behaviors, it calculates similarity scores and assigns suspicion levels (0.0, 60.0, or 90.0) based on predefined thresholds. This mechanism helps flag accounts that may be controlled by the same individual. The similarity calculation method is currently a placeholder, intended to be implemented with actual comparison logic.
