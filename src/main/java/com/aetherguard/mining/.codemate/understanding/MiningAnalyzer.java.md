The `MiningAnalyzer` class is designed to monitor and analyze players' mining activity within a game environment (likely Minecraft, given the use of Bukkit API). It maintains a thread-safe map of player profiles, each tracking the number of blocks mined by a player. The main functionality includes recording each mining action and analyzing the mining data to detect potentially impossible or suspicious mining patterns. Specifically, if a player has mined more than 1000 blocks, the analyzer returns a fixed suspiciousness score (70.0); otherwise, it returns 0.0. This system serves as an exclusive feature to help identify abnormal mining behavior that could indicate cheating or exploits.
