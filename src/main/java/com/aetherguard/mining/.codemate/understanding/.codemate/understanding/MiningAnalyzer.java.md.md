The `MiningAnalyzer` class serves as an anti-cheat tool within a game environment, tracking and analyzing players' mining activities to identify suspicious or impossible behavior. It maintains a thread-safe collection of mining profiles for each player, where each profile records the total number of blocks mined. The class provides methods to update these profiles as players mine blocks and to analyze the collected data, producing a suspiciousness score based on predefined thresholds. This framework is designed for extensibility, allowing more complex detection logic to be incorporated in the future to enhance cheat prevention related to mining actions.
