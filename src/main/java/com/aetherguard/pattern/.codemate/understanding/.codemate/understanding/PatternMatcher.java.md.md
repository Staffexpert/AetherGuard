The `PatternMatcher` class is designed to detect cheating behavior in Minecraft players by analyzing numeric input patterns associated with various cheat types. It maintains a thread-safe map of `PatternProfile` instances keyed by player identifiers, each storing recent pattern data for multiple cheat categories. The class supports detection of several predefined cheat patterns such as perfect clicks per second, linear aiming, constant movement speed, zero jitter, instant reactions, and perfect prediction. For each pattern type, it processes arrays of numeric data using statistical heuristics—like variance, unique value counts, and ratio calculations—to compute a confidence score from 0 to 100 that reflects the likelihood of cheating. It retains up to 50 recent pattern entries per player and pattern type to provide historical context for analysis. The class offers methods to add new pattern data, perform analysis, and remove player profiles, functioning as a backend engine to identify suspicious player behavior through time-series or event-based pattern recognition.
