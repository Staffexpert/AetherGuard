The `PacketInspector` class performs deep packet inspection to identify potential protocol violations within network packets. Its main functionality is provided by the `inspectPacket` method, which takes a byte array of packet data as input and returns a suspicion score ranging from 0 to 100. This score reflects the likelihood that the packet violates protocol rules. The inspection process evaluates the packet for issues such as invalid byte sequences and checksum errors, increasing the suspicion score when such anomalies are detected. If the input data is null or empty, the method returns a default suspicion score of 50. Currently, the specific checks for invalid sequences and checksum validation are placeholders and do not perform actual analysis.
