The `PacketInspector` class provides a mechanism for deep packet inspection aimed at detecting protocol violations in network packets. Its primary method, `inspectPacket`, evaluates a given byte array representing packet data and returns a suspicion score between 0 and 100 indicating the likelihood of the packet being malicious or malformed. The inspection currently considers factors such as the presence of invalid byte sequences and compromised checksums, each contributing to the overall suspicion score. Helper methods `hasInvalidByteSequence` and `hasCompromisedChecksum` are placeholders for the actual detection logic. If the input packet data is null or empty, a default suspicion score of 50 is returned.
