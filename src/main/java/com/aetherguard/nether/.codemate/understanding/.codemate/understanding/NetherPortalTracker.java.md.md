NetherPortalTracker is a utility class for monitoring players' Nether portal usage on a Minecraft server. It uses a thread-safe map to store PortalProfile instances, each tracking the number of times a player has teleported through a Nether portal. The class provides methods to record portal teleport events per player and analyze their usage patterns. If a player’s portal usage exceeds 100 teleports, the analysis flags this with an alert score of 55.0, indicating potentially suspicious behavior; otherwise, it returns 0.0. The nested PortalProfile class manages the teleport count for each individual player.
