NetherPortalTracker is a utility class designed for tracking and analyzing players' usage of Nether portals in a Minecraft server environment. It maintains a thread-safe map of player profiles, each recording the number of times a player has teleported through a portal. The main functionalities include recording each portal teleport event for a player and analyzing their portal usage to detect suspicious behavior. If a player exceeds 100 portal teleports, the analysis method flags this with a specific score (55.0), otherwise, it returns 0.0. The internal PortalProfile class encapsulates the teleport count for individual players.
