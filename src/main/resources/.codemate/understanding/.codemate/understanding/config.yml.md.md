The `PlayerReputationSystem` class manages player reputation for Bukkit-based Minecraft servers by maintaining a thread-safe map of player profiles identified by unique player IDs. Each profile tracks a player's reputation score and violation count. The system allows recording violations that reduce reputation by 5 points (not dropping below 0), incrementing reputation by 1 point per clean hour (up to a maximum of 100), retrieving a player's current reputation (defaulting to 50 if none exists), and determining if a player is "trusted" based on a reputation threshold above 75. The nested `ReputationProfile` class encapsulates individual player reputation data, enabling ongoing monitoring and adjustment of player trustworthiness within the game.
