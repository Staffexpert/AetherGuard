# 🛡️ AetherGuard Punishment Flows
# Define reusable sequences of actions to be triggered by checks.

# This allows you to create complex, escalating punishment systems
# and manage them from a single file.

# You can reference these flows in checks.yml using 'FLOW:<flow_name>'
# Example in checks.yml:
# actions: ["FLOW:minor-movement"]

flows:
  # -- General Flows --
  default-flag:
    - "FLAG"
    - "ALERT"

  # -- Movement Flows --
  minor-movement:
    - "FLAG"
    - "COMMAND:warn %player% Please avoid unusual movement."

  major-movement:
    - "FLAG"
    - "ALERT"
    - "FREEZE:10"
    - "DISCORD:Movement Violation: %player% triggered %check% (%vl% VL)"

  # -- Combat Flows --
  suspicious-combat:
    - "FLAG"
    - "ALERT"

  blatant-combat:
    - "FLAG"
    - "ALERT"
    - "COMMAND:warn %player% Suspicious combat patterns detected."
    - "FREEZE:15"
    - "DISCORD:High-Priority Combat Violation: %player% triggered %check% (%vl% VL)"
